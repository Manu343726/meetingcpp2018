Slides from "C++, QML, and static reflection" at Meeting C++ 2018
=================================================================

Overview
--------

The talk tells the story of rewriting an exisiting application UI, from a web based stack with C++ backend to a pure C++ stack using QML for the frontend.

[Meeting C++ 2018 talk description](https://meetingcpp.com/2018/Talks/items/Cpp__QML__and_static_reflection.html):

> Qml is a declarative UI description language part of the Qt C++ framework for applications. Part of its QtQuick module, Qml brings reactive model-view-model UIs focused on cross-platform application development and touch-friendly mobile-like applications in particular.
In this talk I will present how my team ported our old web based touch UI for our video ip solution ["WM&IP"](https://www.bytechplanet.com/w-and-m/watch-mochi-ip-digital-video-intercommunication-with-ip-technology/) to a full C++ Qt stack using QML for the frontend. Also I will present how we used our own C+ +14 static reflection library ["tinyrefl"](https://github.com/Manu343726/tinyrefl) to automate the creation and export of models to the Qml UI.
